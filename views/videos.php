<p>
	The creation of the above video started with a simple premise: Levyaton running from something, ending in the way that the video ends. 
	The original plan was to have Levyaton's dog chase him, however, the hound was quite uncooperative in our filming efforts, resulting in unusable footage.
	Instead, we opted to use a toy car borrowed from Levyatons sister. 
	Levyaton was filmed in front of a green screen at school by Mia. The backgrounds and intro were her ideas, while the ending and story were Levyatons.
