			<h3>Life is going great right now</h3>
			<p>I started a new job at this awesome company called juicymo. It is, like, 15 minutes from my house and the people there are rad!</p>
			<p>Not only have I started my career relativly early, school seems to be going great as well. Thanks to my job, I am learing how to program in Kotlin, work on apps and </p>
			<p>learnin new concepts, such as GitFlow, working with other threads, databases and proper programming syntax. These things will, and do, come in handy at school</p>
			<p>Meanwhile, school is teching me new types of programming, like this here website, made with css in html and soon, I hope, java script!</p>
			<p>Somehow, I even have a social life, hanging out with friends and going on dates with girls (Thanks Tinder! Any other age, I would probably die alone, thanks to yout, though, it seems I will not!).</p>
			<p>Indeed, things are good. Everything is working out. For now...</p>
